/**
 * Map Data: one map tile, three roads on it joined into one network, a main
 * road across, a crossing road and a side road off it, their kerbs opening
 * where they meet, and the buildings of the blocks between them standing
 * at their own heights. The pointer picks the road nearest it on the tile:
 * its traffic flows, runs of short bright dashes travelling both its lanes,
 * one each way, and its kerbs take the edge; the others stay still. At rest the main road's
 * dashes stand still on it, bright. The buildings never move: the data that
 * changes is the traffic. The slider is the flow's speed.
 *
 * The pattern: one of many, and a flow while chosen. The hit test is the
 * distance to each road's middle on the tile's plane, which never moves; the
 * flow runs only while a road is chosen, and stands still for reduced motion.
 * Let go, the flow runs on for a second, slowing, to the rest phase, and the
 * main road's dashes stand still again where they started.
